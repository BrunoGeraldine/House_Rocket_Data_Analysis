This project contains American real estate analytical insights based on datasets made available by the House Rocket Company in King County (USA)

Case study:
This study project aims to develop tools and panels to answer business questions created by the company's CEO and allow him or other members of the company to have access to different roles for the tool as they select in the filters.

1. Business problem
  House Rocket is currently in the real estate market buying and reselling properties through a digital platform.

  The panel must contain:

  - Data Overview - Database Overview;
  - Properties by zip code - information about properties grouped by zip code;
  - Portfolio Density Map - A map view with database distribution;
  - Property price by timeline - property price by year of construction or by sale date and property price distribution;
  - Distribution of properties by main attributes - distribution of properties by number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors and whether or not the property has a sea       view;
